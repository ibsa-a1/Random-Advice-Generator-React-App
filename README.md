# 🧠 Random Advice Generator – React App

This is a simple and responsive React application that fetches random advice from the [Advice Slip API](https://api.adviceslip.com/advice) and displays it to the user. It features a "Give me advice" button that, when clicked, fetches and displays a new piece of advice.
